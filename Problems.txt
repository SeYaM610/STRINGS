CF Problem 1881A - 
https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1881/A

Searching substring in a string : 
(S1 in S2) - 2 ways : -
 
-> size_t f = S2.find(S1);
-> int f = S2.find(S1);

If found, f gives the index; otherwise, f gives garbage value .

NOTE :- (string :: npos) - To put it simply, think of npos as no-position. As a return value, it is usually used to indicate that no matches were found in the string. Thus, if it returns true, matches were found at no positions (i.e., no matches)
